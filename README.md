Project Name: Monte Carlo Simulator


## Synopsis: 

Show brief demo code of how the classes are used, i.e. code snippets showing how to install, import, and use the code to (1) create dice, (2) play a game, and (3) analyze a game. You can use preformatted blocks for the code.

## API description: A list of all classes with their public methods and attributes. Each item should show their docstrings. All parameters (with data types and defaults) should be described. All return values should be described. Do not describe private methods and attributes.
